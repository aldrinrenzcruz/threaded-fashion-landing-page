# threaded-fashion-landing-page

This project is a single-page e-commerce mockup built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The goal was to implement a responsive, pixel-perfect landing page based on Figma wireframes, featuring an interactive shopping cart that allows users to add and remove items dynamically. Designed as a prototype to showcase front-end development skills and structured for potential scaling.
